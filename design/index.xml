In our initial proposal, the music game we design is similar to those on iPad or PC, for example, Deemo and Cytus. The game rules for these games are clear and easy, while it is hard to play with under the rule: choose the corresponding musical block with music playing in the background.
Thus, we would like to show the game panel on the LCD screen on the Pico4ML chips from Arducam while playing music with a speaker connected to the chip.</description></item><item><title>Diagram</title><link>https://ese519-strawberrypi.github.io/design/modern-hospital/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2018 12:33:46 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://ese519-strawberrypi.github.io/design/modern-hospital/</guid><description>Connect all parts together to build up the project.
Connect the keypad to PIN GPIO 2-5 and GPIO 17-20.
Connect the AUDIO PIN of amplifier to GPIO 1, connect its GROUND to any G PIN on board, and connect its POWER PIN to 3V3 PIN on board.
Connect the Micro USB power supply of the board to any USB port.</description></item></channel></rss>
