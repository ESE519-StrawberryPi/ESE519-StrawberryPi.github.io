Click the `*` button in the panel to enter the Game Mode.

Users may want to play the music game on the device. If so, users may first press `*` to enter the Game Mode. The LCD display will change and show the game page. The user could see the green brick falls down with different x positions. If the user clicks the button before the brick crosses the white line, the brick becomes red, meaning a failure. If the user clicks the button exactly when the brick crosses the white line, the brick becomes yellow, meaning a success. If the user misses the brick without clicking, the brick will not change colors.

After completing the game, the display will show the user's total score. Each successful match will give 100 points. The fail or miss will not cause a deduction in the score.
