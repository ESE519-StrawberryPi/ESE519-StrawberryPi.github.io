Ordered parts shown in the gallery assemble the whole project.

In our initial proposal, the music game we design is similar to those on iPad or PC, for example, Deemo and Cytus. The game rules for these games are clear and easy, while it is hard to play with under the rule: choose the corresponding musical block with music playing in the background. 

Thus, we would like to show the game panel on the LCD screen on the Pico4ML chips from Arducam while playing music with a speaker connected to the chip. Besides being inspired by the MIDI instruments, we would also like to integrate the digital instrumental function into the program, combining both musical games and digital instruments. Definitely good news for music lovers, including us.

To make a music game/ instrument, we use the Pico4ML microcontroller as the core unit.  It would serve as the game's primary host and the digital instrument's center.
